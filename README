TODO Optimization:
1. Simplify loops and remove nested loops where appropriate
2. Evaluate the possibility of letting each ghost run on its own thread to perform computation
3. Create some kind of master list containing all assets to improve cache friendliness when drawing (drawing requires going through all assets, currently they are not in consequtive memory)
4. Consider other techniques to improve cache hits
